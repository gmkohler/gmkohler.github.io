										<h2>Web Developer</h2>
										<p>juicy, layered, articulate.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										I live and write software in Seattle.  I used to write
										software in San Francisco, and before that, I wrote patents and physics equations in Portland, Oregon.
									</p>
									<p>
										My interests in web development lean toward data modelling and architecture,
										particularly in API design, front-end data layers, and front-end component architecture.  I enjoy test-driven development and lean toward object-oriented development, though have begun to be more pragmatic with my philosophies in this grand debate.
									</p>
									<p>
										I can talk your head off about baseball, and am an avid producer and consumer of Indian cuisine.
										You may often find me on a bicycle, in a squash court, or with two planks strapped to my lower extremeties.
										Raised near Seattle, I like cold weather, 90s alternative music, and coffee, but have yet to grow fond of Frasier's highbrow banter.

											<h4> Square, Inc. </h4>
											<h5> Apr 2018 - present, Caviar organization </h5>
										</header>
										<p>
											I have been responsible for the entire lifecycle of a number of business-critical projects, including:
											<ul style="margin-top:0;">
												<li>
													adjusting scheduling software to improve compliance with California labor laws,
												</li>
												<li>
													integrating Zesty’s logistics software with Caviar’s courier-dispatching service to increase labor supply, and
												</li>
												<li>
													establishing a message queueing architecture to support a new Rails service.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p>
											As one of few surviving engineers from Zesty, I've taught new team members how to build applications with Ember.js and Apache Cordova, two frameworks that are used at Zesty but were not used by the team we merged with in Caviar.  Additionally, I am largely responsible for maintenance of dependencies for my team’s many Ember applications.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the realm of wider-reaching knowledge-sharing efforts, I've organized both Square-wide and Caviar-wide meetups to share knowledge of recent changes to Ember framework, and established team processes to improve shared technical understanding of upcoming projects, so we can hit the ground running with sound approaches when it comes time to build.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article>
										<h4> Zesty, Inc. </h4>
										<h5>Apr 2016 - Apr 2018, acquired by Square, Inc. </h5>
										<p>
											I led development and planning of software to support a new snacks product; constructed roadmap for integration of the product with the existing infrastructure
										</p>

										<p>
											Worked directly with internal and external stakeholders to improve restaurant ordering, restaurant account management, meal curation, and timekeeping/payroll management when transitioning catering team from contractors to employees.

												<h4>
													Emoji Exodus | <a href="http://github.com/gmkohler/emoji-exodus">github</a>
												</h4>
												<p>
												In anticipation of Caviar’s impending sale to DoorDash, I led a hack-week team to build a python-powered CLI that uses documented and undocumented Slack APIs to facilitate the migration of emoji from one Slack instance to another.

												<h4>Synthesizer (<a href="http://gmkohler.github.io/synthesizer">live</a> | <a href="http://github.com/gmkohler/synthesizer">github)</a></h4>
												<p>Years ago, I built a synthesizer for the web.
													As a result of my background in both physics and music,
													I've developed an	interest in digital music and audio processing.
													For this project, I built a number of modular React components
													to adjust parameters of the Web Audio API, and to support recording
													and playback via a Track object and Flux architecture.
